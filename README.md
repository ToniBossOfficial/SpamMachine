<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Once you have installed the software you should run it. Once you run it you can type on the 2 input box your 2 lines of text you want to be spammed. After that you can press start. Once you press start you have 5 seconds before the programm starts typing your text. In that space you should open your tab (like a messanger) and click on the box where you usually type. <b>TO STOP THE MACHINE you have to put your mouse cursor on the top right corner of the screen!</b> Have fun, use carefully.

5. There might appear a warning screen by windows defender, this screen pops up because my software isn't verified by microsoft (it needs an license) so you SHOULD click More Info --> run anyway  || THIS IS AN OPEN SOURSE PROGRAMM SO IT CANNOT BE A VIRUS, it is safe :)
